#' Pokémon Go evolutions
#'
#' A key part of Pokémon Go is using evolutions to get stronger
#' Pokémon, and a deeper understanding of evolutions is key to
#' being the greatest Pokémon Go player of all time. This data
#' set covers 75 Pokémon evolutions spread across four species.
#' A wide set of variables are provided, allowing a deeper dive
#' into what characteristics are important in predicting a
#' Pokémon's final combat power (CP).
#'
#' A critical element of Pokémon Go is to "evolve" Pokémon into
#' new, stronger Pokémon for battle. This data set examines
#' evolutions of 75 Pokémon covering four species, and it offers
#' a rich set of 27 variables. The data allow for a careful
#' examination of critical questions related to Pokémon
#' evolutions:
#'
#' 1. What characteristics are important in predicting a
#'   Pokémon's combat power (CP) following the evolution?
#'
#' 2. How reliable is the prediction? Note: an individual
#'   player would not simply care about the average CP after
#'   evolution but also how predictable the final Pokémon's
#'   CP is.
#'
#' 3. Is post-evolution CP linearly related to the Pokémon's
#'   pre-evolution CP?
#'
#' 4. Is the model the same across different Pokémon species?
#'
#' When first diving into the data, consider focusing on the
#' Pidgey species. Next expand to include the Caterpie and
#' Weedle species, and eventually, the Eevee species.
