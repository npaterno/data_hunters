\format{
A data frame with 40 rows and 4 variables.
\describe{
\item{patient}{A number assigned to each patient.}
\item{cell}{Type of cell, either "LNCaP" (prostate cancer cell)
or "NIH3T3" (immune system cell).}
\item{serum}{When the serum was collected, either "before" or "after" exercise.}
\item{growth}{Cell proliferation, measured in arbitrary units.
(Arbitrary units mean relative values are important but the
absolute values are not.)}

}
\description{
Blood serum is a component of blood important to the immune system.
In this study, blood serum was collected from 10 men, both before
and immediately after exercise. Each of these serum samples, two from
each man, were then exposed to two types of cells. The first type,
LNCaP, is a type of prostate cancer cell. The second type, NIH3T3,
is an immune system cell. The growth of the two types of cells was
recorded after 48Â hours.
